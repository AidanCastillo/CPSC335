Algorithm #1: Change string in source code to see if valid palindrome.


Algorithm #2: edit source code to provide it source file path. This Algorithm works by reading a file that contains the long string array and the array with the city names. The provided text file had all three test cases. When running the code edit the file to only have one test case at a time.

For example, when testing the first case the text file will only contain

array 1a =[“sanoaklandrialtofullertonmarcolongbreacoronamodestoclovissimithousand”]
array 1b = [‘brea’, ‘modesto’, ‘clovis’, ‘corona’]

When moving on to check the next test case replace what's in the file with the next case

IE 

array 2a =[“marcopolmonafremontrialtofullertonmarcolongfresnochinoclovissimisalinas”]
array 2b = [‘fullerton’, ‘chino’, ‘fremont’, ‘fresno’]
